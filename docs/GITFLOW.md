# gitflow branching strategy

For feature branches:

- May branch off from `develop` branch.
- Branch naming convention: `feature/*`
- Commit some changes in the feature branch and then push it.
- In gihub/gitlab/bitbucket make a PR from your branch to `develop`.- - After the PR is merged, delete your feature branch.
